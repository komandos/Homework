						<h1> Our Veterinarians Bring Extensive Experience</h1>

						<p>Wisdom Pet Medicine was founded by Dr. Darren Winthrop, Dr. Elizabeth Chase,
							and Dr. Kimberly Sanders to bring the best in traditional and alternative
							medicine to the local community. The three doctors met while pursuing their
							veterinary education at Colorado State University, one of the nation&rsquo;s
							top-rated vet schools. After going their own ways (for almost a decade), to
							work for different veterinary clinics across the country, the doctors
							decided it was time to combine their diverse knowledge and skills under one
							practice at Wisdom Pet Medicine.</p>

									<p>Dr. Winthrop is the guardian of Missy, a three-year old Llaso mix, who he
										adopted at the shelter (he just couldn&rsquo;t resist those sad eyes). Dr.
										Winthrop is passionate about spay and neuter and pet adoption, and works
										tireless hours outside the clinic, performing free spay and neuter surgeries
										for the shelter.</p>

									<p>Dr. Chase spends much of her free time helping the local bunny rescue
										organization find homes for bunnies, such as Kibbles. This cuddly Dalmatian
										bunny is part of the large Chase household, which also includes two dogs,
										three cats, and a turtle.</p>

									<p>Leroy walked into Dr. Sanders&rsquo; front door when she was moving into a
										new house. After searching for weeks for Leroy&rsquo;s guardians, she
										decided to make Leroy a part of her pet family. Leroy has settled into his
										new home, and especially enjoys playing with Dr. Sanders&rsquo; other
										cats.</p>
